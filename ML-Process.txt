1. Scraping data from sources and storing the raw contents

2. Filtering out unneeded content (links, stopwords, numbers,...)

3. -Scale = Change range of feature values, shape doesn't change. Proportions stay the same.
            Range is often set at 0 to 1
   
   -Standardize = Changing values of features to output something close to normal distribution
   
   -Normalize = can be used to mean either of the above

   => this step is not needed for random forest
   => Use MinMaxScaler as the default if you are transforming a feature. It’s non-distorting.
