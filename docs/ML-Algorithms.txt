REGRESSION ALGORITHMS
Models the relationship between variables (features) and is iteratively refined using measure of error
in predictions 

=> Logistic regression



INSTANCE-BASED ALGORITHMS
Typically build up a database of example data deemed to be important or required 
to the model. Then we compare new data to this database using similarity measure
to find the best match

=> Support Vector Machines


BAYESIAN ALGORITHMS
Algorithms based on the Bayes theorem
(describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.)
with the "naive" assumption that every feature is independent.


DECISION TREE ALGORITHMS
Construct a sequence of decisions concerning the features that are related to the target label. The sequence forms
forks until a prediction decision can be made for the given record.

=> Random forest is combination of multiple random decision trees.
